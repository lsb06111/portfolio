I am trying to persuade the players of global warming. These days there are lots of problems with global warming. Among many problems, the iceberg sinking issue is the main topic of this game. This game basically has the monsters that represent garbages that are bad for the environment and character(hero) that represents human. In the game the iceberg is sinking in every second which indicates the global warming is currently happening so the aim for this game is to get the high score before the iceberg is totally sinked or the character dies.

The players can upgrade their abilities which help killing monsters with the button ' + ', but the level of the iceberg decreases. What this means is that human uses natural resources to upgrade themselves, such that they build buildings and cut tress, which affects the level of the iceberg. However, the character can also upgrade their abilities without using natural resources, which does not affect the level of the iceberg. That is to use coins that the players will gain when they kill the monsters. 8 coins are required to upgrade each ability with the button '++'. The players gain 2 coins when a monster is killed. What this means is that when humans clean the world and they will get reward such as coins in the game. 

I put lots of images of which colours are bluish because the iceberg colour is close to blue. Because the game is based on the iceberg, I put images that are related to the iceberg such as ice, ice button, snowy background and igloo for the character's room. I put a virtual monster that can be tested by players about how strong they are, in the character's room(igloo). Also, the players can only upgrade when the character is in the character's room. 

I made the game more attractive by having the iceberg level increase by 10 for every 100 scores (which means as the players clean the garbage, the iceberg level increases)and bonus score that is given to players when they get 200 scores. The monster will be upgraded when the level is 2 and the level is up when they get 200 scores. Also, the coins are stored even though the game ends so that they players might want to play games again and again to collect the coins.
